# RPM-display-using-BLDC-motor
A microcontroller-based system to control the speed of a BLDC motor using PWM and display its real-time RPM on an LCD. Includes keypad input, IR sensor feedback, and opto-isolated motor driving.


## 🚀 RPM Display & Speed Controller for BLDC Motor
🛠️ Project Overview

This project implements a microcontroller-based system for controlling the speed of a BLDC (Brushless DC) motor and displaying its real-time RPM (Revolutions Per Minute). The motor speed is regulated through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals generated by the microcontroller, based on user input. An IR sensor monitors the RPM, which is then shown on a 16x2 LCD screen.

## 🔧 Key Features

✅ Real-time RPM measurement using IR speed sensor

✅ Speed control via PWM signal generation

✅ 16x2 LCD interface to display live RPM

✅ User input through keypad or switches

✅ Safe motor control with opto-isolated MOSFET driver

## 🔄 How It Works
🔹 1. User Input

The user enters the desired RPM using a keypad or switches.

This input is read by the 8051 microcontroller.

🔹 2. RPM Measurement

The IR speed sensor detects motor shaft rotations.

The microcontroller counts the pulses over time to calculate RPM.

🔹 3. PWM Control

Based on the difference between actual and desired RPM, PWM pulses are adjusted.

The PWM signal passes through an opto-isolator and drives the MOSFET, which powers the BLDC motor accordingly.

🔹 4. Display Output

The actual RPM is continuously updated and shown on the LCD screen.

## 📐 Circuit Breakdown

Sensor Interface: IR sensor output connected to digital pin (e.g., P3.2/INT0) for pulse detection.

PWM Generation: Using Timer modules on AT89S52 to generate PWM signals.

Motor Driver: Opto-isolator provides isolation; MOSFET handles power switching.

LCD Display: Operated in 4-bit mode using Port 2 for data, and P3.0, P3.1 for control lines.

Keypad: Connected to Port 1 for reading user inputs (4x3 or 4x4 matrix).
